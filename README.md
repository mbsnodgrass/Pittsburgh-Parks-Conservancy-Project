Data consulting project for the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy.

We're a four-person team of cohort peers conducting rigorous data analysis for the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy in their effort to organize public investment funding priorities, using tools including statistical analysis using spatial features in R and geospatial analysis in QGIS. We are cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing demographic census data, environmental and public health metrics, and other factors to break down socioeconomic patterns at the urban community level anchored around public parks.

We are developing an index using a variety of data sources to measure investment need of each park in Pittsburgh and observe patterns and disparities. We're seeking to understand how equitably park budgets are distributed across neighborhoods of varying socioeconomic statuses, and whether the levels of investment in parks correlate poverty rates and racial concentration in surrounding areas or "walksheds." Are there disparities in how park funds are distributed, particularly when comparing racially concentrated areas of poverty (RCAP) to more affluent neighborhoods? Can a predictive machine learning model be developed to forecast future park funding needs using historical data, demographic trends, and environmental factors based on recorded patterns from the past decade of data?
